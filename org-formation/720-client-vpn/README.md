# Overview
Setup and configure the AWS client Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the
org-sagebase-transit account.

![alt text][architecture]

## Setup AWS client VPN
We setup the AWS client VPN leveraging routes that were created by the
[transit gateway](../710-tgw/README.md) configuration.

### Setup IDP
We federate users to the VPN with [Jumpcloud SSO](https://support.jumpcloud.com/support/s/article/Single-Sign-On-SSO-with-AWS-Client-VPN)
which allows users to login to the VPN with their Jumpcloud credentials.
This will also allow us to manage VPC access thru Jumcploud user groups.

### Setup Jumpcloud
We need to setup two SSO apps in jumpcloud because it does not support multiple ACS URLs.
We need one SSO for the VPN connection and another one for the VPN self service portal.

Follow [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html)
to create a certificate using [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa)
then import the certifcate to the AWS certificate manager

Create a `transitvpn` SSO app for VPN access:
  * SP Entity ID: `urn:amazon:webservices:clientvpn`
  * ACS URL: `http://127.0.0.1:35001`
  * Enable `Declare Redirect Endpoint` option
  * IDP URL: `https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/transitvpn`
  * Attributes: `FirstName=firstname`, `LastName=lastname`, `NameID=email`
  * Enable `Group Attributes option` and set it to `memberOf`

Create a `transitvpnssp` SSO app for the VPN self service portal access:
  * SP Entity ID: `urn:amazon:webservices:clientvpn`
  * ACS URL: `http://127.0.0.1:35001`
  * Enable `Declare Redirect Endpoint` option
  * IDP URL: `https://self-service.clientvpn.amazonaws.com/api/auth/sso/saml`
  * Attributes: `FirstName=firstname`, `LastName=lastname`, `NameID=email`
  * Enable `Group Attributes option` and set it to `memberOf`

### Setup AWS SAML Providers
After setting up Jumpcloud SSO we can let org-formation deploy the [_tasks.yaml](_tasks.yaml)
file which will create the AWS SAML providers.

## VPN Management

### Setup Jumpcloud User Groups
The AWS VPN is integrated with Jumpcloud SSO.  We can use JC to manage user group access to
VPCs.  The first step is to create JC user groups.

To create JC user groups:
* Login to JC with admin role
* Create a new JC User Group
* Associate the new user group to JC SSO apps `transitvpn` and `transitvpnssp`
![alt text][jc_sso_association]
* Associate JC users to the user group.

Continue to the next section to setup VPN authorization for the newly created
JC user group.

### Configure VPN authorization
Once the JC user groups have been created we need to configure the VPN to allow
the JC user groups access to specific VPCs.

Create a PR in this repo with the following changes to [_tasks.yaml](_tasks.yaml):
1. Add a new entry to the `Vpn.TemplatingContext.TgwSpokes` dictionary.
2. The `CIDR` is the VPC IP address that the VPN should allow access to.
3. The `AccessGroup` value(s) must match a Jumpcloud defined `User Group`. This allows
the Jumpcloud user group(s) access to a VPC defined by its CIDR.
4. Review and merge PR

Once merged and deployed the VPN routes will be updated to route traffic from the
hub VPC to the spoke VPCs.  It will also allow the JC user groups authorization to
access the VPC.  Now the JC user group should have full access to resources in the
VPC.

__Note__:
* VPN users may get disconnected on this VPN update, the VPN client app should automatically reconnect once
the operation is complete.
* It is recommended to only add one VPC at a time which means you should split up your PRs to add one spoke VPC per PR.
* The `ServerCertificateArn` parameter value should be the certificate that was created by easy-rsa and
imported into the AWS cerfiticate manager.

## VPN User Workflow
VPN users must use a VPN client to access cloud resources

* Login to the [Sage IT VPN portal](https://vpn.sageit.org)
* Download the VPN client configuration file
* Download the AWS Client VPN application
* Install and run the client VPN app
* Load the configuration file into the VPN client:

File -> Manage Profiles -> Add Profile -> select the downloaded configuration file -> Add Profile -> Done

* Now use the VPN client to `connect`

Once connected you should have access to cloud resources.  Access to resources is managed in Jumpcloud with User Groups.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome.

Requirements:
* Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) app
* Clone this repo
* Run `pre-commit install` to install the git hook.

## Testing
As a pre-deployment step we syntatically validate our sceptre and
cloudformation yaml files with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com).

Please install pre-commit, once installed the file validations will
automatically run on every commit.  Alternatively you can manually
execute the validations by running `pre-commit run --all-files`.
Please install pre-commit, once installed the file validations will
automatically run on every commit.

## Secrets
* We use the [AWS SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html)
to store secrets for this project.  Sceptre retrieves the secrets using
a [sceptre ssm resolver](https://github.com/cloudreach/sceptre/tree/v1/contrib/ssm-resolver)
and passes them to the cloudformation stack on deployment.
